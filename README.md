I'm Jake, and trying to catch up on the things I should have studied in college.

I'm currently learning data analytics and random coding stuff.  Mainly focused on learning SQL at the moment.

I'm loking for help with getting a job in data analytics/software (but I don't know enough yet to get a real job)
